# Sentiment-Analysis

The dataset that I am using for the task of Squid Game sentiment analysis is downloaded from Kaggle, which was initially collected from Twitter while people were actively sharing their opinions about Squid Game.

I utlized word cloud to take a look at the most used words in the Squid Game opinions. A word cloud is a data visualization tool that displays the most used words in a larger size. 

Conclusion:
The total of negatives is much lower than that of Positive, so we can say that most of the opinions on the Squid Game are positive.
