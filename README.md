# Sentiment-Analysis

The dataset that I am using for the task of Squid Game sentiment analysis is downloaded from Kaggle, which was initially collected from Twitter while people were actively sharing their opinions about Squid Game.

I have first removed the column not needed in our analysis.

I utlized word cloud to take a look at the most used words in the Squid Game opinions. A word cloud is a data visualization tool that displays the most used words in a larger size. 

The “text” column in the dataset contains the opinions of the users of Twitter about the squid game, as these are social media opinions, so this column needs to be prepared before any analysis. 

I have added three more columns in this dataset as Positive, Negative, and Neutral by calculating the sentiment scores of the text column

Conclusion:
The total of negatives is much lower than that of Positive, so we can say that most of the opinions on the Squid Game are positive.
